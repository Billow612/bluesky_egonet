### Interpretation from the Visuals
![overview of case 2](case_2.1.png)
This network demonstrates a clear dominance of the ego account as the central hub within its community. Its significantly deeper blue colour sets it apart from the rest of the ego-net, indicating a high in-degree. However, its relatively small node size reveals a low out-degree, suggesting limited reciprocity or follow-back behaviour.
Beyond the ego account, only a small number of nodes display noticeably deep colouring, signalling comparatively high influence. These include `threadinburgh.scot`, `scottishindider.org`, e`dinburghminute.bsky.social`, `edinreporter.bsky.social`, and `amzomac.bsky.social`. While these nodes are often scattered individually, they also form small local clusters. Thematically, most are connected to Edinburgh or Scottish news and culture, indicating shared audience segments with the ego account.
The overall connection density of the network is relatively low (0.0115), characterised by a high proportion of single-direction relationships and limited interconnection between alter accounts. This structural sparsity produces an asymmetrical shape, with a noticeable cluster of nodes on the left consisting of accounts that follow only the ego account and no one else in the network. These may represent users with casual or sporadic interest, or potentially automated accounts created to inflate follower numbers. ![part of case 2](case_2.2.png)
