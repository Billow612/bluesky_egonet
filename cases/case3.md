### Interpretation from the Visuals
![overview of case 3](case_3.png)
The overall colour of this network is relatively deep, reflecting a high degree of interconnection among members of the community. Unlike institutional or official-page ego-nets, the personal account network appears more diverse, with numerous alter nodes standing out at first glance. Nodes with both high and low in-degree are distributed evenly across the graph. While the target account is the largest and deepest-coloured node, it is positioned toward the fringe rather than the centre. This suggests that the ego account exerts influence and engages in interactions comparable to those of its friends, rather than dominating the network.
Structurally, the network is nearly circular, indicating an absence of distinct sub-clusters or specialised interest groups. This is consistent with the personal nature of the ego account’s connections, which are formed primarily through individual relationships rather than around a unifying theme or topic.
